Comments: 
TensorFlow (library)+ Keras (library) + Python (language)+
 Spyder (cross-platform integrated development environment)
 are used to classify 3 facial expressions classes of IKFDB
 (RGB-D) face dataset [1] using Convolutional Neural Network
 (CNN) deep learning. Please cite [1] paper if you used the code. 
Number of samples is 1500 which each class contains 500 ‘jpg’
 images. Main folder of ‘deeplr’ contains three subfolders of
 ‘Joy’, ‘Neutral’ and ‘Sadness’. 
Custom dataset: You can easily replace your desire dataset
 here in the main folder and put each class in a separated 
 subfolder. Also, you can increase or decrease number of 
 classes. Of course, you have to change ‘num_classes = 3’
 argument according to your number of classes.
Please feel free to contact me for any issues or guide:
